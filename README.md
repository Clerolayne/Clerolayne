<h3 align="center">"Data tells a story. Businesses, like our lives, are shaped by narratives. Data analysis enables the understanding of these narratives to generate insights that will serve as the foundation for making informed decisions. Therefore, when we look at the data, we take control of the story instead of leaving it to chance."</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Industrial Planning and Production Manager**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **to use Python and other programming languages in conjunction with Power BI for data analysis and reports creation. I am also improving my English skills.**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **the continuous improvement of organizational processes through data analysis**

- 💬 Ask me about **I hold a Bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and began my career in the telecommunications sector as a process analyst for mobile services. During this time, I discovered my passion for technology and data analysis. Observing the rapid evolution of the market and the growing demand for skilled professionals in technology, I decided to make a significant shift in my career. In 2021, I immigrated to Portugal to pursue a master’s degree, which opened a great opportunity for me in the industrial sector. Upon entering the field of industrial planning, I identified a shortage of professionals equipped to apply modern technologies to optimize production processes. Leveraging my skills in Excel, Power Query, and Power BI, I started implementing data analysis solutions that enhanced the company’s operational efficiency. These improvements not only brought significant results but also positioned me as a key contributor to the sector’s digital transformation.Currently, I am deepening my knowledge through a master’s program in Data Modeling, Analysis, and Decision Support Systems at the University of Porto, with the aim of continuing to make a positive impact in the industry through innovative data analysis solutions.**
