<h3 align="center">"Data tells a story. Businesses, like our lives, are shaped by narratives. Data analysis enables the understanding of these narratives to generate insights that will serve as the foundation for making informed decisions. Therefore, when we look at the data, we take control of the story instead of leaving it to chance."</h3>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Industrial Planning and Production Manager**

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **to use Python and other programming languages in conjunction with Power BI for data analysis and reports creation. I am also improving my English skills.**

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **the continuous improvement of organizational processes through data analysis**

- 💬 Ask me about **I began my career in the telecommunications sector, where I worked as a process analyst for mobile services. During this time, I discovered my passion for technology and data analysis. However, upon observing the rapid evolution of the market and the growing demand for technology professionals, I decided to make a significant change in my career. I immigrated to Portugal in 2021 as a master's student and found a great opportunity in the industrial sector. Upon entering the sector as a planner, I realized there was a shortage of qualified professionals capable of utilizing modern technologies to optimize production processes. Initially, by using only my skills in Excel, Power Query, and Power BI, I began implementing data analysis solutions that improved the operational efficiency of the company. My work not only brought significant improvements but also positioned me as a key professional in the digital transformation of the sector. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge through a master's program in data modeling at the University of Porto.**
